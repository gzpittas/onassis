  <h2>Recommended Workflow</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>For best results, follow this order when adding new research:</p>
    <ol class="help-steps">
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Source first</strong><br>
        Before documenting any events, create a record for the book, article, or documentary you're reading. This allows you to link entries back to their origin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Characters as you encounter them</strong><br>
        When you come across a new person in your research, add them to the Characters database before creating entries that involve them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Create Timeline Entries</strong><br>
        Document events as you read, linking them to the source and any characters involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mark entries as Verified</strong><br>
        When you find the same event confirmed in multiple sources, mark it as verified to indicate higher confidence.

  <h2>Tips for Writers</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Using the Timeline View</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the <strong>decade filter</strong> to focus on specific eras (e.g., the 1960s for the Maria Callas affair and Jackie Kennedy marriage)</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>event type filter</strong> to find all business deals, marriages, or scandals</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>character filter</strong> to see all events involving a specific person</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Significance Field</h3>
